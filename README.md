ASSAYYED_KITCHEN_V1.82_STABLE

no longer maintained, this is the last version, <br/>
taken from https://mega.nz/#!fAIkBZKQ!aS-9yNL9GKgVzgJd9C5DWJtjD_fNM6bHTiz-1KnsydA <br/>
original thread was https://forum.xda-developers.com/chef-central/android/best-android-roms-editor-assayyedkitchen-t3410545 <br/>
<br/>
I've UnUPX (unpacked the UPX compression) most of the files, but that's it, other than that it's the latest (semi-)unmodified version of v1.82.
<br/>
Note: I would recommend you'll use a newer better "kitchen" such as SuperR's free version: https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/linux-free-superrs-kitchen-v1-2-1-2-7-24-20.3597434/ .
Although you'll need to use a virtual-machine and linux for the free version (the donated version have a Windows variation),  
editing the content of many files (boot.img internal-storage, extracting files from a sparse img by mounting or even just proper text-based files such as build.prop) requires proper root-permission system or a proper linux-EOL shell some the end result wouldn't f\*\*\*ed-up your device, and - no - Cygwin is not an alternative, and yes - it took me a while to figure it out!
<br/>
Anyway, you can easily download the whole thing using: https://github.com/eladkarako/ASSAYYED_KITCHEN/archive/master.zip
